Through the course of this project, I've solidified alot of the concepts ive learnt! It helped me better understand inheritance and polymorhism 
(having an array of perishable and non perishable items in an items array). I also experienced alot of virtuals and saw how they were transitive. 
(Out of curiosity I ended up looking up VTables and going down that rabbit hole). Honestly the most difficult part for me was keeping track of all 
my display formatting! This is what caused me the most issues when submitting. Other than that this project was tedious but otherwise straight forward!
I just wish we had more control over the design of our implementation to solve the issue provided.
