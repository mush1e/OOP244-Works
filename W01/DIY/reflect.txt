This assignment did not have a large learning curve, since it was majorly
based on topics covered in IPC144 last semester. It was a good refresher for modules,
File handling and sorting in my opinion! The one observation I made is there isnt need
to handle too many cases based on the tests provided. For example I dont have to handle a 
case where a double of precision 2 is entered for the GPA. I used strings and split it to 
parse my input I don't know if theres a better way to do this but this is what I thought of
 right away. I havent written code in c++ before so encountering namespaces was interesting. 
 I love how I dont have to worry about the names I declare conflicting with other declarations,
 so I can pick the names that make the most sense! I'm excited to get into more c++!
