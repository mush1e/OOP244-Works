The set of assignments for this week were fairly straight-forward. The implementation was very simplistic and 
didnt take too much time. It was a good refresher for Access Modifiers and the syntax to define methods in C++.
The main difficulty I faced was the wording of the assignment. Alot of my peers agree that the assignment was very vaguely 
worded and difficult to parse. It would also have been useful to include some aspect of Dynamically allocating memory 
in this assignment since it would have served as a good refresher to last weeks work. Also I was excited to work with 
constructors and destructors dynamically allocating and deallocating memory upon inception and deletion of instances of
our classes. Also this assignment felt alot more guided (kinda like an IPC assignment), We didnt really have to think of a solution for
ourselves. Other than that looking forward to the upcoming assignments.
