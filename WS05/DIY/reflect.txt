From the workshop, I was able to learn a lot about operator overloading. I had the opportunity to practice and become better at overloading different types of operator functions, 
including Type conversion, Unary and Binary operator functions, and how to properly call them in another function. 
One of the essential things I learned is the format for calling a bool function, where bool(*this) checks if the bus is in service, 
returns true if it is and false if it's not.

I also gained a better understanding of the keyword "const" and how to set parameter values by default. 
The workshop also helped me differentiate between helper functions and member functions and how to write them correctly. 
Additionally, I learned about the importance of using "using namespace std;" in header files if I use ostream & istream.

During the workshop, I encountered some challenges with some subtle mistakes that could cause errors in my code. 
For example, I mistakenly set default values twice (in the header file and cpp file). However, 
I learned from my mistakes and corrected them to prevent such errors in the future.
