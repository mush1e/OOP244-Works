I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

During the workshop, I learned several things. Firstly, I learned how to correctly override parent class functions in 
child classes. It's important to ensure that the prototypes of the functions are the same. Secondly, I learned how to
 write a class that can act as an interface for its child and grandchild classes. To do this, all functions' prototypes i
 n the header file, including the destructor, should be virtual, and all other member functions should be set to =0. 
 Lastly, I learned about the importance of the "const" keyword. I encountered an error when I forgot to add "const" 
 in the child display function, even though I had added it in the parent display function. This caused issues with compilation, 
 but I was able to resolve it by correctly overriding the functions.

The most difficult part of the workshop for me was overloading the >> and << operators as helper functions. I initially used load() 
and play() as instructions, but it didn't work because the child classes hadn't overridden the functions yet. This caused a lot of 
confusion, and I had to try several different approaches to resolve the error. Eventually, I realized that I should ignore the error 
for the time being, as it would disappear automatically once I had overridden the virtual functions in the child classes.
